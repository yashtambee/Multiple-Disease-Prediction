# Multiple-Disease-Prediction
### Introduction

The goal of this research is to create a machine learning model that uses the Random Forest algorithm to predict multiple diseases in individuals. Healthcare providers can more quickly and efficiently decide on a patient's course of treatment by precisely identifying the presence of numerous diseases in that patient, improving patient outcomes and lowering healthcare costs.

### Data
The dataset used in this project contains information on patient's diagnostic information such as symptoms. The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values and categorical variables.

### Algorithm
The project makes use of the Random Forest algorithm, an ensemble learning technique that aggregates the predictions of numerous decision trees once they have been built. Because it can handle high-dimensional and unbalanced datasets, is computationally efficient, and is relatively simple to implement, Random Forest is seen to be a suitable option for multiple illness prediction.

### Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

Python 3.0
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy

### Usage
Clone or download the repository
Install the required dependencies
Run the command python main.py to train and evaluate the model
Or open the code in google colab & run all cells (press Ctrl + F9)
The model can be used to predict the presence of multiple diseases in new patients by passing their diagnostic information as input to the trained model

### Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing dataset.

### Conclusion
In the healthcare sector, Multiple Disease Prediction utilising Random Forest can be quite advantageous. Medical personnel can more quickly and efficiently decide which treatments to provide to patients who have numerous diseases by correctly diagnosing them, which improves patient outcomes and lowers healthcare costs. A greater knowledge of the underlying causes of many diseases and the development of new treatments can result from using the model to find patterns and correlations between diseases.
